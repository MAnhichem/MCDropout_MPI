# MCDropout_MPI
This code is based on the work carried out in the paper "Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning" (2015) and developed in [Yarin Gal's github repository](https://github.com/yaringal/DropoutUncertaintyExps). They showed that dropout in multilayer perceptron models can be interpreted as a Bayesian approximation. They are able to approximate the epistemic uncertainty in deep learning without without a trade-off on performance.
